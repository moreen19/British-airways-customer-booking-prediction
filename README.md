Predictive modeling of customer bookings(Full project available in files section)

In this project i try to predict complete customer bookings at British airways based and indentify which variables have the most impact on whether a booking is completed or not.

First, i explored the data in order to better understand what we have and the statistical properties of the dataset and cleaned and transformed the data so that its in the required format 
for analysis.

I then used Random forest and XGB classifiers to predict the bookings.

## RESULTS

According to the results from the models shown above the Random forest classifier model gives a more accurate prediction with 0.848 accuracy levels and the 4 most important features with regard to customer booking prediction are :

Purchase lead time

No of flight hours

Length of stay

Flight duration
